            <div id="conter"><h1>The Controversy</h1></div>
         <div id="win"><p>The events that led to Max Verstappen claiming his first-ever F1 title "will be discussed and addressed with all the teams and drivers to draw any lessons from this situation", the organisation said in a statement.Clarity about the regulations will be provided to the drivers, media and fans in time before the beginning of the 2022 season, it added.
             British driver Lewis Hamilton had led for almost all of Sunday's race and had been on course to win a record-breaking eighth world title.
             But he was overtaken on the final lap by Verstappen after a safety car came on the track to deal with a Nicholas Latifi crash just five laps from the end.
            Verstappen, who was in second at the time, changed his tyres during the delay, while Hamilton stayed out in the lead to keep track position on his older set.There were initially five lapped cars between the two title contenders in the queue behind the safety car.
            Race director Michael Masi decided that only those five should be allowed to unlap themselves, instead of all lapped cars as is the usual procedure.
